# compound-component-example
Small example of a compound component in React
=======
This is just a quick repo showing a couple of components using the compound component pattern.

This project is bundled with Vite - tou can run the repo with npm run dev, and the tests with npm run test.

In 2024, I want to learn and use more design patterns in my day to day work, and the compound component pattern is a React one I see mentioned often.
The sketches I did before building these components are included in the root of the repo.
